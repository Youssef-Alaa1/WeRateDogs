This project was done as an End Year Project for DECI, Below is a short description of the project. Hope you enjoy it.
WeRateDogs (@dog_rates) is a very popular Twitter account. It has 7.84M followers. Each 
twitter has a image and its unique  rating system. In this project, we have three kinds of datasets, 
Twitter archive data including the basic tweet information, image prediction that have done by a 
neural network and additional data from Twitter API.  After taking a look at the datasets, I've 
been interested in finding that which dog stage is the most popular . Sorry, reality is cruel or I am 
a mean person loll. Even though all the dogs are good dogs, I am eager to know who is the most 
popular one ;p  Besides rating system, which is weird because most of numerators are bigger 
than denomintors, I assume that favorite count and retweet count can be good metrics to 
measure the popularity among dogs (I want to re-emphasize again: I am a mean person and I 
want to compare dogs.). So, before doing anything mean, (oopss, dogs' owners! Don't hate me. I 
am only an analyst here.) I want to know favoriate count is correlated with retweet count?
